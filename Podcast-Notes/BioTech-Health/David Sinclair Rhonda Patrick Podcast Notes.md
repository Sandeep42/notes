David Sinclair Rhonda Patrick Podcast Notes

* Anti aging genes: Discovered them in the 90's.
* Tweaking epi-genome to accelerate or decelerate age.
* Sirtuins: SIR4 when mutated makes yeast live longer.
* Mimicking calorie restriction.
* 30% less than we normally eat. Intermittent fasting, sirtuins will come naturally with fasting. Beneficial with out eating less.
* Intermittent Fasting kicks Ketogenic metabolism.
* Calorie restriction improves 5-10x sirtuins in certain organs. Not having insulin is key.
* Sirtuins are regulated by NAD+. Sourced of NAD: Exercise & calorie restriction, fasting, or NAD booster.
* During day time, NAD levels are high. Relationship between circadian rhythm and NAD. The clock is regulated by NAD.
* Why NAD is important? Metabolism. Glucose, Fatty acids.
* Different pathways of metabolism l, going back into 3 billion years
* Does NAD contribute to aging?
* Without NAD, sirtuins don't work. Like a Pacman.
* Can we manually increase NAD? Is it helpful??
* Sirtuin is the car, but the fuel is NAD. Resveratrol is the accelerator.
* NAD is required by activated immune cells. Lot of energy required
* Chronic inflammation in old age. Need more. But less available. DNA damaged can not be repaired.
* Old cells become sterile as DNA damage increases. Lose their identity.
* Information theory of aging. We are losing information as we age. Because of inflammation. Can we go back and reset?
* Epigenome responsible for biomarkers of aging.
* DNA methylation can predict chronological age. 10 years older than you should be.
* Epigenetic markers permanently damage the information.
* Manipulating epigenome can reset the biological clock!
* Yamanaka Factors. 4 factors. Pultipotent stem cell. Highly influential work.
* Interplay between yamanaka Factors can help mouse live longer 40%.
* Reset the methylation clock.
* Reversal of aging through yamanaka Factors, epigentic clock reset.
* Fasting and epigentic clock. Slow the rate of the clock.
* Genome is digital information, epigenome is analog reader.
* NAD Boosters: Dietary Supplements that increase NAD levels
* NAD is recycled every time. NAD is big, nicotinamide is small Difficult to get absorbed
* NMN (precursor to NAD) with a transporter can be absorbed.
* NR (Nicodinaminde Riboside)
* Resveratrol and aging
* If you are always sitting, then all these metabolic pathways don't get activated. Unless you are stressed.
* Resveratrol  less cardio vascular disease, less cancer, neuro generative disease, dna repair
* David Sinclair is taking Resveratrol 1 gm each day. His heart has shown no signs of aging.
* Autophagy: Cell Death.
