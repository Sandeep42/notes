Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning

## Key Concepts:

## Key Bottlenecks:

### Modelling Social Interactions:

* Most ignored aspect of Climate Change, we interact and learn from others. If you want to induce a behavioral change in people, one has to understand their aspirations and rewards.
* Agent Based Modelling techniques where each agent acts independently or cooperatively can help to understand some of the dynamics. It is important to study the tipping points or phase transition points when a significant portion of the society is read to change.
* ABM is limited by lack of data, and good design. Generative models or State Representation Models like Markov Chains, HMM's can be applied to model agents better.
* Reward Based learning or Multi-agent RL could be potentially used to discover new solutions or interactions between previously unconnected processes.

### Policy Information:

* Things like Cost- Benefit analysis, model driven profit calculation can help the governments to evaluate better policies. ML models could potentially use existing data and also calculate lost benefit by not bringing a policy earlier than now.
* For example, Germany initiated solar & wind generation earlier than anyone, they have now set a record by supplying 78% of electricity through renewable for one day. This type of long term thinking based on hard calculations should be given to the government so that they can decide to do this well before.

### Assessing Policies

* Integrated assesement models which use a combination of economic and climate impacts.
