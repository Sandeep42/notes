# GHG emissions in the Industry

## **Key Concepts:**

1. Better forecasting in terms of demand and supply from data.
2. Better Material alternatives that have low carbon footprint (using generative models from ML)

### Optimizing Supply Chains:

* Predict demand, supply and optimize shipping routes in transportation.

#### Reducing overproduction:

* More production generally is more revenue. Perishable goods, if mass produced without keeping the predicted demand in mind would generate a lot of GHG emissions.
* Just in time manufacturing using data aggregation from online stores might help to reduce emissions on the manufacturing.

#### Recommender Systems:

* Recommend firms about climate-friendly options.
* Could be difficult because most companies do not share their proprietary data to others.

#### Reducing food waste:

* ML can help by doing better demand forecasting so that the food won't go waste.
* Better refrigeration could be used to mitigate some of the waste.
* Mostly wasted because we don't know exactly when it gets to a state beyond usable. If there's a sensor which can predict if food is going to be wasted, we can decrease the prices and thereby eliminate the impact on the climate.

### Better Materials

#### Climate Friendly Construction:

* Cement and steel production together account for over **10% of all global GHG emissions**.
* Can we engineer structures that can use low carbon footprint alternatives for construction? ML can be used in generative design. You can have for example an RL model trained to optimize for strength. For a long, we struck to the same old architecture, maybe ML can bring a bit of entropy into the system and find more optimal solutions. Where's the data? Materials Project
* Low emission concrete with same structural properties.

#### Climate Friendly Chemicals:

* Ammonia accounts for **2% of all global GHG emissions.** Not possible to eliminate because we need food to survive and modern agriculture requires ammonia to fix the soil. Better agricultural techniques exist but people got used to this old method that it might be difficult to shift now.
* New catalysts or new methods that enable low temperature ammonia production can help in reduction of these emissions.

### Production and Energy:

#### Reducing overall electricity consumption:

* The missing piece is mostly data. We don't know how much energy we are wasting.
* By installing better sensors in industries that do manufacturing, we can track energy consumption & come up with solutions if they are required.
* Old equipment should be replaced for better low carbon technologies. Unless, the companies are incentivized it might be difficult to drive this.
* If an outsider can come and do evaluation, may be say that you can save 10-20% electricity, would companies be willing to co-operate?

#### Adaptive Control:
