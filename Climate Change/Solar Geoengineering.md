## Key Concepts:

1. Realising that we can not possibly keep our emissions in check, study solar geoengineering as a last-ditch effort in case everything we tried fails. Extermely unlikely to go forward if there are other alternatives.
2. Studying chemicals which have reflecting properties, injecting them into stratosphere of Earth and thereby controlling the temperature on the Earth surface.


## Key Bottlenecks:

1. Political & Ethical implications are huge. Very unlikely to get a nod from all the countries.

### Aerosol Injection:

* Prone to controversies
* Irreversible damage if done recklessly
* Natural process: Volcanoes release sulphates into atmostphere. These aerosols reflect more energy than Earth naturally does and hence there is a cool down effect. But, do we want to tinker around with the only planet we have? And, how to we even get all countries to accept the experiements? Solar engineering is not a science problem but a problem coming from ethical and political reasons.

### Aerosol Discovery & Design:

* ML can be used to discover new aerosols and study existing aerosol performance.
* Modelling how these aerosols interact with the global environment is really crucial if geoengineering is go forward. ML can pinch in here and help in designing good models for the interactions.


### Control Problems:

* We can treat aerosol injection as a control problem and use it figure out what time and amount of aerosols must be required for optimal performance.
* Lot of uncertainity around the data, would be very challenging.

### Modelling Impact:
* Instead, we can model the impact of aerosols on the environment. Can it improve our health? What would be the temperature post aerosol injection?
