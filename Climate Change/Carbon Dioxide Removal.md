## Key Concepts:

1. Storing Co2 & inferring better materials and places to sequester it
2. Low impact on the environment

## Key Bottlenecks:
1. New market for sequestering must be created.



### Direct Air Capture:

* Minimal impact on the environment
* Use C02 Sorbents to capture it in the air, and sequester into purified form
* ML can be used in finding new materials and increasing the efficiencies in this process.


#### Storing Co2:

* Where to store the captured Co2?
* Saline aquifiers, volcanic formations
* ML can be used to identify potential locations for storing 
* Inferences on what locations could be used, maintained for integrity without leaks back into the atmostphere can come from ML.
