# Deep Medicine

## Intro & Chapter-1, 2

* The lack of "care" in the current healthcare system worries the author.
* Average time spent with the patient decreased drastically in the recent past.
* Since doctors are overworking and under lot of stress all the time, the chances of wrong classification of a diagnosis increase.
* Without proper prior conditions, expensive scans were done to patients which leads to a lot false positives. This phenomenon contributes a major percentage of healthcare spends of a country.
* Lack of proper maintained healthcare records, proprietary data formats prohibit engineering better solutions with regards to diagnosis, maintenance and prediction.
* Deep Neural Networks can offload some of this work of doctors thereby allowing them to understand patients as individuals. With assisted AI technologies, healthcare may finally be able to put "care" back into it.
* With increasing populations, it is better to invest in AI healthcare technologies as we can not train enough physicians to diagnose them all.

## Chapter 3

* In general to diagnise any disease, there are two ways to approach it. 
	* Quick off-the shelf within 5 minutes solution
	* Slow retrospective thinking and then providing a diagnosis
* Doctors in general follow the first method. Is there any issue in using it?
* Doctors are prone to 
	* Availability Bias: A doctor can only read and treat a fixed number of conditions although a database of all conditions exists. This is called the "availabiliy" bias.
	* Confirmation Bias: Instead of using priors across all patients, doctors tend to overestimate the likelyhood of conditions on which they have observed past data. This could potentially lead "confirming" diseases confidently without considering the other alternatives.
* **Building Knowledge based systems:** There have been many attempts by various companies to aid doctors by building a knowledge base from existing medical reports. IBM Watson is a notorious example. These systems started off with a hype, we were initially led into thinking that this is an easier problem. Turns out, machines understanding medical diagnosis is much harder than giving generic responses.
* **Crowdsourcing Doctors:** Some apps are catered to doctors seeking second opinions of a diagnosis they did. Author claims that they are successful to some extent in bringing knowledge together.
