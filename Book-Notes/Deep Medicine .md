# Deep Medicine

## Intro & Chapter-1, 2

* The lack of "care" in the current healthcare system worries the author.
* Average time spent with the patient decreased drastically in the recent past.
* Since doctors are overworking and under lot of stress all the time, the chances of wrong classification of a diagnosis increase.
* Without proper prior conditions, expensive scans were done to patients which leads to a lot false positives. This phenomenon contributes a major percentage of healthcare spends of a country.
* Lack of proper maintained healthcare records, proprietary data formats prohibit engineering better solutions with regards to diagnosis, maintenance and prediction.
* Deep Neural Networks can offload some of this work of doctors thereby allowing them to understand patients as individuals. With assisted AI technologies, healthcare may finally be able to put "care" back into it.
* With increasing populations, it is better to invest in AI healthcare technologies as we can not train enough physicians to diagnose them all.
