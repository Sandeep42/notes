# Pair Open Ended Trailblazer (POET): Endlessly Generating Increasingly Complex and Diverse Learning Environments and Their Solutions

[https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01753](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01753)

* Curriculum learning: Learning through iterative process of solving increasingly complex environments
* So many concepts crunched into one single algorithm. Very interesting read.
* How to optimise multiple agents with cooperation in enviroments that are also evolving?
* Natural evolution is a prime example of agents evolving together in an environment where the env itself changes either naturally or through interactions of agents with the enviroment. 
* What if we can generate a cirruculum of increasingly complex environments? Would it help the agents to learn and generalize quickly? How can we maintain and encourage novel solutions from the pool of agents? Is diversity required?
